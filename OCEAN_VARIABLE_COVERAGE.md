## ✅ All Variables Supported

### Oceanographic Variables

| Variable | Status | Keywords | Data Available |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Temperature** | ✅ Working | temperature, temp, warm, cold, heat | Yes (all regions) |
| **Salinity** | ✅ Working | salinity, salt, saline | Yes (all regions) |
| **Pressure** | ✅ Working | pressure, depth, deep | Yes (all regions) |
| **Dissolved Oxygen** | ✅ Working | oxygen, o2, dissolved oxygen, do | No data in DB |
| **pH** | ✅ Working | ph, acidity | No data in DB |
| **Nitrate** | ✅ Working | nitrate, nitrogen | No data in DB |
| **Chlorophyll** | ✅ Working | chlorophyll, chl | No data in DB |

### Variable Extraction Examples

```
"show me temperature in pacific" → temperature
"what is the salinity" → salinity
"find pressure data" → pressure
"dissolved oxygen levels" → dissolved_oxygen
"ph measurements" → ph
"nitrate concentration" → nitrate
"chlorophyll data" → chlorophyll
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Expanded Ocean Coverage

**Atlantic Ocean Bounding Box Expanded:**
```python
# Before
'atlantic': [-80, -60, 20, 70]  # Too narrow

# After
'atlantic': [-100, -60, 30, 70]  # Full Atlantic coverage
```

**Arctic Ocean Threshold Adjusted:**
```python
# Before
'arctic': [-180, 60, 180, 90]  # Started at 60°N

# After
'arctic': [-180, 66, 180, 90]  # Arctic Circle at 66°N
```

**Southern Ocean Alias Added:**
```python
'southern': [-180, -90, 180, -60],
'south': [-180, -90, 180, -60]  # Alias
```

### 2. Enhanced Variable Detection

**More Keywords Per Variable:**
```python
# Temperature
['temperature', 'temp', 'warm', 'cold', 'heat']

# Salinity
['salinity', 'salt', 'saline']

# Pressure
['pressure', 'depth', 'deep']

# Dissolved Oxygen
['oxygen', 'o2', 'dissolved oxygen', 'do']

# pH
['ph', 'acidity']

# Nitrate
['nitrate', 'nitrogen']

# Chlorophyll
['chlorophyll', 'chl']
```

### 3. Improved Location Matching

**All Oceans in Comparisons:**
```python
# Now supports all 5 oceans in comparisons
if 'arctic' in question_lower:
    oceans.append('Arctic Ocean')
if 'southern' in question_lower or 'south' in question_lower:
    oceans.append('Southern Ocean')
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No floats found in Arctic Ocean"
**Reason:** No floats are currently deployed in the Arctic region (above 66°N)
**Solution:** This is expected - Arctic deployments are rare

### "No dissolved oxygen data"
**Reason:** The current database doesn't contain dissolved oxygen measurements
**Solution:** This is a data availability issue, not a code issue. The system will work when data is available.

### "Atlantic Ocean returns fewer floats than expected"
**Reason:** Bounding box might not cover all Atlantic regions
**Solution:** We've expanded the bounding box to [-100, -60, 30, 70] to cover the full Atlantic

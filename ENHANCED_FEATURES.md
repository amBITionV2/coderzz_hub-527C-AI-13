# FloatChat Enhanced Features

## 🆕 New Capabilities

### 1. Ocean-to-Ocean Comparisons

Compare oceanographic data between two or more ocean regions with side-by-side statistics.

**Example Queries:**
```
"compare temperature between pacific and atlantic ocean"
"compare salinity between indian and atlantic ocean"
"compare temperature and salinity between pacific and indian ocean"
```

**Response Format:**
```
🔍 **Comparison between Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean**

**Pacific Ocean:**
  • 31 floats, 495,061 measurements
  • Temperature: 7.05°C (range: 1.49°C to 57.59°C)

**Atlantic Ocean:**
  • 34 floats, 284,654 measurements
  • Temperature: 7.22°C (range: -2.26°C to 61.87°C)

**Key Differences:**
  • Temperature: Atlantic Ocean has 0.17 units higher average

💡 Comparing data from 65 total floats across regions
```

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of comparison intent
- Side-by-side statistics for each region
- Calculated differences between regions
- Combined float count across all regions

---

### 2. Smart Query Rejection

The chatbot now intelligently rejects irrelevant queries that are not related to oceanographic data.

**Rejected Topics:**
- Weather forecasts
- Stock market
- News
- Sports
- Movies/Music
- Recipes
- Games

**Example:**
```
Query: "what is the weather today"

Response: "Sorry, I cannot help you with that. I specialize in oceanographic 
float data including temperature, salinity, pressure, and dissolved oxygen 
measurements from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Please ask about 
ocean data!"
```

**Helpful Suggestions:**
When rejecting a query, the chatbot provides relevant example queries:
- "Show me active floats"
- "What is the temperature in Pacific Ocean"
- "Compare salinity between Atlantic and Indian Ocean"
- "Find floats measuring dissolved oxygen"

---

### 3. Actionable Recommendations

Recommendations are now specific, queryable suggestions that users can directly ask as follow-up questions.

**Old Style (Generic):**
- "Consider examining temperature and salinity profiles"
- "Visualize data on a map"

**New Style (Actionable):**
- "Compare Pacific Ocean with Atlantic Ocean"
- "Also examine salinity in this region"
- "Show me temperature data for these floats"
- "What is the pressure in Atlantic Ocean"

**Context-Aware:**
Recommendations adapt based on the current query:
- If querying Pacific → Suggests comparing with Atlantic
- If showing temperature → Suggests adding salinity
- If no location → Suggests specific ocean regions
- If no status filter → Suggests filtering by active floats

**Example:**
```
Query: "show me temperature in pacific ocean"

Recommendations:
  • Compare Pacific Ocean with Atlantic Ocean
  • Also examine salinity in this region
  • Filter by active floats only
  • Compare temperature between Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean
```

### 4. Float Highlighting

When displaying results, the chatbot now highlights which specific floats are being shown.

**Features:**
- Shows float IDs in the insights
- Displays up to 10 float IDs
- Indicates if more floats exist ("...")
- Enables future highlighting in map view

**Example:**
```
Found 31 floats with 886 profiles and 495,061 measurements.

📍 Geographic Coverage: 111.3° latitude × 359.8° longitude
📅 Data Period: 2025-10-04 to 2025-10-04

🌊 Oceanographic Data:
  • Temperature: 7.05°C (range: 1.49°C to 57.59°C)

💡 Showing data from 31 floats (IDs: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37...)
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Research Scenario 1: Regional Comparison
**Goal:** Compare ocean temperatures between Pacific and Atlantic

**Query:** `"compare temperature between pacific and atlantic ocean"`

**Result:**
- 65 floats analyzed
- Side-by-side statistics
- Key difference: Atlantic 0.17°C warmer on average

**Follow-up:** Click recommendation "Also examine salinity in this region"

---

### Research Scenario 2: Multi-Variable Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze temperature and salinity together

**Query:** `"compare temperature and salinity in pacific ocean"`

**Result:**
- Temperature: 7.05°C (1.49°C to 57.59°C)
- Salinity: 34.57 PSU (2.02 to 36.87 PSU)
- 495,061 measurements analyzed

**Follow-up:** Click recommendation "Compare Pacific Ocean with Atlantic Ocean"

---

### Research Scenario 3: Focused Analysis
**Goal:** Study only active floats in a specific region

**Query:** `"show me temperature data for active floats in indian ocean"`

**Result:**
- Filtered by status (active)
- Filtered by region (Indian Ocean)
- Temperature statistics provided
- Float IDs highlighted for reference

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Comparison Query Detection
```python
# Detects keywords: compare, between, versus, vs
if 'compare' in query or 'between' in query:
    # Extract ocean names
    oceans = extract_oceans(query)
    # Query each ocean separately
    # Generate side-by-side comparison
```

### Rejection Logic
```python
# Check for irrelevant keywords
irrelevant = ['weather', 'stock', 'news', 'sports', ...]
if any(keyword in query for keyword in irrelevant):
    return rejection_message()
```

### Actionable Recommendations
```python
# Context-aware suggestions
if parameters.location == 'Pacific Ocean':
    recommend("Compare Pacific Ocean with Atlantic Ocean")
if parameters.variables == ['temperature']:
    recommend("Also examine salinity in this region")
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Comparisons:
1. **Be Explicit:** Use "compare" or "between" keywords
2. **Specify Variables:** Mention which parameters to compare
3. **Use Standard Names:** Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean

### For Recommendations:
1. **Click to Query:** Recommendations are designed to be clicked/copied
2. **Follow the Flow:** Recommendations guide you through analysis
3. **Iterative Exploration:** Each query suggests logical next steps

### For Highlighting:
1. **Note Float IDs:** Use IDs for reference in reports
2. **Cross-Reference:** Match IDs with map markers
3. **Subset Analysis:** Query specific float IDs if needed
